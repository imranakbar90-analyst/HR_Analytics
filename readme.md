#  HR Attrition Analytics Dashboard  

A Power BI project that explores **employee attrition (turnover)** to uncover key factors, high-risk departments, and actionable insights to improve employee retention.  


##  Project Overview  

This analysis provides a **data-driven understanding** of employee turnover patterns within the organization.  
It combines **Power Query data cleaning**, **interactive dashboards**, and **drill-down visualizations** to help HR teams identify and act upon attrition causes.


##  Dataset Overview

This project uses the **HR Analytics Dataset** from Kaggle, containing details of **1,470 employees** across departments.  
The dataset includes information on demographics, job roles, satisfaction levels, income, performance ratings, and attrition status.  

**Key Columns:**  
- `Age`, `Gender`, `Department`, `JobRole`  
- `MonthlyIncome`, `DistanceFromHome`, `JobSatisfaction`  
- `YearsAtCompany`, `Attrition` (Yes/No)

##  Project Architecture 

Data Source → Power Query (Cleaning & Transformation) → Data Model (Relationships, Measures, DAX) → Power BI Dashboards (KPIs, Decomposition Tree, Insights)

##  Data Cleaning & Preparation  

Performed in **Power Query (Power BI)** to ensure accuracy and consistency.  

**Key Transformation Steps:**
-  Removed duplicates & handled missing/null values  
-  Corrected data types (e.g., ensuring numeric fields were not stored as text)  
-  Created meaningful categorical **bins** for:
  - Age Groups → *Young Professionals*, *Mid-Career*, *Experienced*  
  - Income Ranges → *Low*, *Medium*, *High*  
  - Tenure Bins → *Early Tenure*, *Mid Tenure*, *Veterans*  
  - Job Satisfaction → *Low*, *Medium*, *High*, *Very High*  
  - Distance from Home → *Near*, *Mid Range*, *Far*

##  Analytical Approach  

| Phase | Objective | Description |
|:------|:-----------|:------------|
| **Identification Phase** | Locate high-attrition departments | Identified which departments (Sales, HR, R&D) had the highest attrition rates using aggregated metrics and visuals. |
| **Investigation Phase** | Diagnose root causes | Explored job-related and demographic factors such as salary, tenure, job satisfaction, and distance from home. |
| **Insight Phase** | Translate findings into action | Derived HR-specific recommendations for improving retention and employee engagement. |

## 📊 Dashboard & Key Insights  

The Power BI report includes:  
 An **Overall Company Dashboard**  
**Department-level Dashboards** (Sales, HR, R&D)  
 An **Interactive Decomposition Tree** for root-cause analysis  

### 🔍 **Key Findings**  

| Insight Category | Observation | Impact |
|:-----------------|:-------------|:--------|
|  **Departments** | Sales (20.63%) & HR (19.05%) have the highest attrition rates | Require targeted retention strategies |
|  **Demographics** | Younger, single employees with shorter tenures and lower salaries are more likely to leave | Indicates early-career disengagement |
|  **Work-Life Balance** | Employees living farther away and with low job satisfaction show higher turnover | Suggests need for hybrid/flexible options |
